# CS Tutor

## Description

This project aims to develop an AI tutor powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist university computing students with advanced concepts. The AI tutor is be able to access local knowledge, search live websites, and provide concise explanations.

## Getting started

### Ollama

To serve an LLM locally, we run [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for its ease-of-use and accessibility for many popular models. For more information on its installation, refer to [Ollama's official repo](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/).

After installation, run `ollama run mistral:7b` (or another model of choice). This downloads the model before serving it through the Ollama API on `http://localhost:11434`.
